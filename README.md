# acid-evaluation
Some script I used for making graphics for a chemistry report.

It's pretty easy, the data file has two columns, volume in mililiters and pH, just need to edit those and this will give a scatter plot of your evaluation, followed by the calculation of the graphic of the derivative and the viration point in the evaluation, with that data it's pretty easy to figure out the initial molarity of the acid used in said evaluation.

Datos file and Chem3.py need to be in the same folder, all the graphics will be saved in said folder.
